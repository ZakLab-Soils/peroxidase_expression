Information about this repository

##### **Sequencing Data**
Sequencing was done at the University of Michigan Sequencing Core using a PacBio-RS II system. FASTQ files were submitted to the NCBI Sequence Read Archive under BioProject [PRJNA222775](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA222775) with SRA accession numbers [SRX3857909](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRX3857909[accn]).

##### **Directories:**
1. **MOTHUR:** contains all files necessary to run **MOTHUR**, including the batch file, oligos files and taxa related files. 
	- **28S.paired.oligos.zip:** all `.oligos` files for separating reads by plot
	- **fungal.lsu.reference.zip:** 28S reference database files used for alignment and taxonomy assignment for fungi

2. **QPCR:** contains the .csv files from the the 18S and peroxidase qPCR, including sample information, ct and copy numbers.

3. **Lignogroups:** contains the data tables used for the determination of highly lignolytic fungi, including information about which taxa are included as defined by Entwistle et al (accepted) in *Ecological Monographs*.

4. **R code:** contains and Rmarkdown document for all statistics run for the manuscript and the environmental file used for PERMANOVA.
