A fasta file from each representative OTU at a distance of 0.01 was created in MOTHUR. This rep.fasta file was analyzed with
the RDP Classifier (Version 2.11) against the 28S LSU trainset 11. This taxonomy table was combine with the shared file
created in MOTHUR, as it works as an OTU table, to create the document RDP_Shared.csv.

All OTUs with classifications at the genus level below 80% were removed, as well as any that were classified as non-fungal.
This updated OTU/Taxa table was subset for Total Fungi, Agaricoymetes and highly lignolytic taxa. Highly lignolytic taxa (HLT) 
are defined in Entwistle et al, 2018 (Table 2, Tables S2 & S3) and only thoese with a >20 sequences per OTU were used.

The data was analyzed with ANOVA by sqaure root transforming the relative abundance of the HLT to Agaricomycetes or total 
sequences.
